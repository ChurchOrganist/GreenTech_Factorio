GreenTech_Factorio is a Factorio mod which alters the game to use green technology systems instead of the fossil fuel systems currently used in the game.

It is based on the BioTech mod by SlopppyEngineering, which in turn uses code from the Bio Industries mod by TheSAguy.

GreenTech_Factorio takes the concept a little further than its predecessor mods in that it alters the vanilla recipes, meaning that the player has to use green technology, rather than having it as an alternative. Consequently there is no use for either coal or oil in the recipes, and I would recommend setting coal and oil patches to None, whilst playing with this mod.

It also introduces air filters into the game which will reduce pollution.

Currently the mod is in the design stage. Please feel free to contribute to the mod by forking and submitting pull requests - if you are able to provide new graphics you will be particularly welcome :)
